# üìç AI-Powered Anti-Phishing System ‚Äì Development Roadmap

This document outlines the phased development plan for building a scalable, AI-driven anti-phishing system using the selected tech stack.

---

## üß± Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture

### Goals:
- Set up foundational infrastructure
- Prepare codebase for modular development
- Establish development and deployment workflows

### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up GitHub repo and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Create containerized dev environment (Docker + Docker Compose)
- [ ] Deploy Kubernetes cluster (minikube for local or EKS/GKE for cloud)
- [ ] Design core microservice structure (FastAPI + gRPC)
- [ ] Create schema for PostgreSQL (email logs, scores, metadata)
- [ ] Configure Kafka and Redis (real-time message handling)
- [ ] Set up S3-compatible storage (e.g., MinIO) for attachments

---

## üß† Phase 2: AI Model Development

### Goals:
- Build and train phishing detection models
- Serve inference APIs for real-time use

### Tasks:
- [ ] Collect and preprocess phishing/non-phishing datasets
- [ ] Train:
  - [ ] Text-based classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, XGBoost)
  - [ ] URL reputation models
- [ ] Save and version models (MLflow or custom system)
- [ ] Deploy models using TorchServe or NVIDIA Triton
- [ ] Expose REST/gRPC API for scoring emails

---

## üì¨ Phase 3: Email & URL Processing Pipeline

### Goals:
- Integrate email services and enable full ingestion-to-inference flow

### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate Microsoft Graph API and Gmail API for inbox access
- [ ] Parse emails (headers, body, attachments)
- [ ] Create sandbox pipeline using Selenium for embedded URLs
- [ ] Integrate Google Safe Browsing API for URL checks
- [ ] Store parsed results in PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 4: Threat Intelligence & Response Automation

### Goals:
- Enhance detection with threat feeds
- Enable automatic response and alerting

### Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate threat intelligence sources: MISP, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB
- [ ] Add YARA rule scanning for attachments
- [ ] Build risk scoring logic to trigger:
  - [ ] Quarantine actions
  - [ ] SOC notifications
  - [ ] Email recall (via API)
- [ ] Use Celery or Kafka workers to automate workflows

---

## üåê Phase 5: Frontend & Analyst Interface

### Goals:
- Build a web dashboard for visibility and control

### Tasks:
- [ ] Build dashboard using React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- [ ] Integrate phishing log views, scoring history, and alerts
- [ ] Add filters for email metadata, domains, sources, etc.
- [ ] Add manual override tools for analysts (e.g., release, retrain)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6: Cloud Scaling & Monitoring

### Goals:
- Productionize the system and ensure high availability

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Helm charts for deployment to K8s clusters
- [ ] Use Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and dashboards
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- [ ] Configure backup strategy for S3/PostgreSQL

---

## üß† Phase 7: (Optional) LLM & LangChain Integration

### Goals:
- Add LLM-based explainability and interactive triage

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add LangChain agent that:
  - [ ] Summarizes phishing rationale
  - [ ] Answers analyst queries via chatbot or Slack plugin
- [ ] Integrate vector DB (FAISS or Weaviate) for similarity search
- [ ] Build LLM-driven phishing report generator

---

## üöÄ Final Deliverables

- [ ] REST/gRPC API for phishing classification
- [ ] Real-time detection pipeline (email + URL + attachments)
- [ ] Web dashboard for security analysts
- [ ] Threat intelligence and sandboxing integrations
- [ ] Optional LLM agent for enhanced triage

---

## üìå Notes

- Use modular service design for clean handoff between detection, response, and reporting
- Keep all services containerized for easy CI/CD and horizontal scaling
- Prioritize clear logging and traceability for post-incident forensics
